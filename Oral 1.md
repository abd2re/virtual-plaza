## Exratct brief
Here, in Chapter III, as Bell and Torbert discuss the sheer number of bodies that have turned up, Bell starts to realize that they are dealing with a new kind of criminal, a type he hasn’t encountered before. He always believed that drug dealers were the more contemporary version of the cattle rustlers that his grandfather, also a sheriff, had to deal with, but what Bell has seen so far has made him change his mind. The criminals Bell now faces are a different type. They are not simply trying to make a buck, they’re also willing to inflict a horrifying level of violence and destruction to achieve their goals. Bell says he has never seen anything like these people before, and that is a strong statement coming from a man who fought the Nazis in Europe. These criminals represent the modern face of the drug trade, and as the novel expresses, this brutal industry permeates all levels of society.

## Theme: The Inevitability of Change
_No Country for Old Men_ pits an “old man” who values justice, morality, and lawfulness against a world in which younger men act according to their own codes. Bell specifically addresses the idea of change, expressing his distaste for new morals, fashions, and customs of contemporary society. He continually compares the present time unfavorably to previous ones. Bell’s attitude is not wholly unexpected. In his years as a sheriff, he has had a front-row seat on crime, and he believes that the new type of drug criminal represents a shift toward lawlessness and chaos, which will only worsen. As bad as Chigurh is, he is simply a harbinger of the future. However, while Bell holds a nostalgic vision of the past, other details that emerge show he is romanticizing it to some extent. For instance, Ellis tells him the truth about a relative who was killed by the Native Americans, showing that violence was always a part of American society. It just took a different form in earlier days. Another relative died at the age of seventeen in World War I. The world always outlives the beings that populate it, and the older generation usually is the first to feel out of step.

## Theme: The Battle of Good and Evil
The age-old theme of the battle between good and evil underlies _No Country for Old Men_, from its plot points and its dependence on violence to the characters and how they change throughout the novel. Moss is a morally ambiguous man. He steals the money, knowing what he risks, and then gets identified as the thief because he returns to the scene to perform an act of kindness: bringing water to the one survivor. During the novel, readers see Moss waver on which side he falls, representing the battle between good and evil that rages inside of him.

This battle also manifests between law enforcement and the men who work for the drug dealers. Law enforcement tries to catch up with the criminals but consistently remains a few steps behind and shows up only in time to clean up and collect the bodies. 

The characters of Bell and Chigurh most definitively embody this battle. Bell represents the side of good, through his role as a sheriff but also through his ideas about what that job entails. The role of sheriff is an elected role—at one point Loretta reminds him they still owe thousands of dollars from his campaign—so Bell’s job is truly one of service to his community. He feels a compelling need to protect the people in his county, not merely to enforce law and order. Chigurh, on the other hand, not only murders people for his livelihood, but he also seems to be a living incarnation of evil. He kills people, such as Carla Jean, for no reason other than his distorted philosophy. Bell recognizes this frightful aspect of Chigurh. When faced with such evil, Bell doesn’t think that good can prevail, and he opts out of his position as sheriff to avoid facing such evil again. In essence, in this battle, evil wins out over good.

## What is the point behind No Country for Old Men?
Exemplifying the wonder for purpose and meaning of man's existence, the picture instead makes its readers wallow in their own dread, showing that **the world is going too fast for them to keep up no matter how hard they try**.

## Brief summary
While out hunting, Llewelyn Moss finds the grisly aftermath of a drug deal. Though he knows better, he cannot resist the cash left behind and takes it with him. The hunter becomes the hunted when a merciless killer named Chigurh picks up his trail. Also looking for Moss is Sheriff Bell, an aging lawman who reflects on a changing world and a dark secret of his own, as he tries to find and protect Moss.

Our three characters

### Anton Chigurh 

The antagonist of the novel. Chigurh works with criminals as a hitman and “fixer.” He is a remorseless killer who lacks empathy for his victims. Chigurh is supremely self-confident and at times seems almost omnipotent. He believes that people are fated to certain futures, including to die at his hand, by all the choices they have made.

### Llewelyn Moss 

A Vietnam vet who sets the novel's events into motion. At thirty-six, Moss is a self-sufficient and clever man who makes the fatal mistake of stealing money from drug dealers and returning to the scene to give water to a dying man. Moss shows ingenuity in his flight from Chigurh and the other men chasing him, but ultimately he cannot outrun them. He refuses to bargain with Chigurh to save the life of his wife, Carla Jean.

### Sheriff Ed Tom Bell 

The sheriff of Terrell County, Texas, and protagonist of the novel. At fifty-seven, Bell serves as the sheriff of his community and feels responsible for keeping people safe. To him, the world is changing in ways he can’t keep up with. He believes Chigurh represents a new kind of evil and he leaves his job rather than risk facing someone like him again.

How are the themes of the inevitability of change and the battle between good and evil presented in "No country for old men" by Cormac McCarthy ?

The inevitability of change and the battle between good and evil has been around since the dawn of mankind. Although these concepts are different depending on the context, they are definitely present in our world. The novel "No country for old men" puts these themes forward through a character name Sheriff Ed Tom Bell, an old sheriff who values justice, morality, and lawfulness against a world in which younger men act according to their own codes. To answer this question we will use an excerpt of the book that flawlessly puts in place those two concepts.

The excerpt start by Sheriff Bell's assistant reporting a crime that has just happened where a police officier got bludgeoned in the head. This passage emphasize the brutal nature in the book where many other similar incidents take place regularly. As years as a sheriff, Sheriff Bell loses his grip around protecting his entourage with violence becoming more and more rampant, he  addresses the idea of change, expressing his distaste for new morals, fashions, and customs of contemporary society who corrupt people. 

Bell is nostalgic about the past where things were simpler even romanticizing to an extent, he tells that his father who was a Sheriff as well wouldn't even need a weapon to combat justice, because people back even bad people back then had a sense of morality and conduct according to him. But the truth is, like Sheriff Bell's friend said, this kind of hyperviolence has always existed because we tend to be delusional about the past. Sheriff Ed Tom Bell says this new kind of evil is like no other, that he even think good will never prevail over evil, indeed he believes so much there aren't any solutions that he decided to retire from his jobs because he's overwhelmed. 

We as human tend to think that good things will always last but the truth is that change is inevitable. As we grow older, reality strays further from our control, hence the name of the book "no country for old men". But despite the evil that happens, there will always be people that will carry on the fire and be the positive force against evil.
