## Methodology Essay Writing

Writing a TOK essay is not so much about answering questions, rather it is about shedding light on a knowledge question. That's what you are trying to do. We are unlikely to come up with a definite solution.

Because the TOK essays deals with open-ended and questionable questions, there is an important personal element to it. While you may be able to learn from similar explorations made by others, it is important that your essay voices your opinion and arguments, and that you acknowledge your own perspective and assumptions as a knower.

- To explore a knowledge question, you need to explain what the problem in the essay title is and why it matters. 
- To clarify the meaning of any keywords or key terms in the essay title.
- Undercover hidden assumptions that are taken for granted.
- Offer a thesis statement that answers the knowledge question.
- Argue your case for your thesis with a clear argument or a coherent sequence of arguments.
- Consider different ways of thinking about the problem.
- Investigate and evaluate different perspectives.
- Identify, construct and evaluate both arguments and counter-arguments.
- Use specific examples or evidence to make a point or support a discussion.
- Assess and evaluate supporting evidence.
- Make relevant connections, explore links and comparaisons between areas of knowledge where relevant.
- Apply the [[12 TOK Concepts]] and ideas as you see fit.
- Think through the implications of an argument or a conclusion and what follows.

1. Please not what the tittle is asking you. Make sure you understand the key terms and the question it is asking. What kind of knowledge is being elicited ? Would you focus on personal knowledge or shared knowledge.
