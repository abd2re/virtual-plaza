# Can new knowledge change established values or beliefs?

## Object 1: Heliocentric model from Nicolaus Copernicus

This heliocentric model from Nicolaus Copernicus is said to be the first iteration of our solar system, where the Sun is at the center while Earth and the other planets are orbiting around in circular motion. For the first time, geocentrism, widely accepted to be the correct representation of our universe, was contradicted. This new knowledge was controversial because many cultures and religious doctrines believed in an Earth-centred universe. Heliocentrism challenged the authority of religious institutions and led to conflicts as the new model contradicted the traditional interpretations of religious texts. The acceptance of the heliocentric model instead of the inaccurate geocentric model required a reevaluation of those beliefs.

The heliocentric model also marked a change in how we seek knowledge; instead of relying solely on religious or philosophical dogma to explain natural phenomena, the heliocentric model emphasized empirical observation, experimentation, and evidence-based reasoning. The acceptance of the heliocentric model played an important role in how we inquire about scientific knowledge and the scientific method. Not only is the discovery of the heliocentric model pave the way for advancements in physics, astronomy, and other scientific fields, but it had philosophical and existential implications by redefining Man's place in the universe. Before the heliocentric model, the traditional belief was that humans held a special place in the universe; the heliocentric model did not only imply that Earth was just one of several planets orbiting the Sun but that there also may be other stellar systems and galaxies.

It's vital to remember that the heliocentric model's acceptance took place gradually and met with opposition from several sources. The impact of this new understanding of the world on morals and beliefs took centuries for society to accept. The discovery of the heliocentric model is an example of new knowledge completely changing established values and beliefs. The acceptance of the heliocentric model challenged established beliefs by contradicting the prevailing geocentric view and religious interpretations. It sparked a scientific revolution, questioned religious authority, redefined humanity's place in the universe, and expanded knowledge and understanding.

This image is a wall painting from 1200 BC showing an Ancient Egyptian from the Neolithic era in his field. The Neolithic period began around 10,000 BC and ended in 2,000 BC. This era has seen the invention of agriculture, which is getting commonly overlooked despite being one of humanity's best achievements. Agriculture caused a shift from a nomadic lifestyle to a settled lifestyle. Previously, societies had a hunter-gatherer lifestyle, and settling for agriculture shifted the focus to settled life, cultivation of crops, and establishment of communities, instead of reliance on hunting and gathering. Agriculture allowed for an unseen amount of food led to changes in social structure to maximize output and efficiency. These surpluses of food: reduced famine, made the populations more healthy, and drastically increased the growth of civilizations. 

Agriculture also introduced the concept of land ownership and private property. With agriculture, people started to find specific areas for their crops. The idea of owning land has impacted social dynamics, power structures, and the development of legal and economic systems. The advent of agriculture laid the foundation for economic systems beyond subsistence and opened the door for new concepts like trade and bartering. The transition to an agricultural culture brought a new respect for time and the seasons' cyclical nature. Agriculture significantly impacted dietary patterns and beliefs about nutrition. Societies became more dependent on domesticated plants for food as they developed the ability to produce crops. This transition influenced diet changes, the availability of more food options, and the evolution of culinary techniques. Agricultural communities frequently established dietary-related cultural beliefs and practices, such as making gifts to gods for a plentiful harvest or emphasizing the value of shared meals. These dietary and nutritional practices and beliefs have become part of cultural traditions. To synthesize, the advent of agriculture challenged and transformed established values and beliefs, demonstrating the capacity of new knowledge to reshape societal perspectives and belief systems.

This image is a picture of ChatGPT's website on a laptop. ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence chatbot developed by OpenAI and released in November 2022. ChatGPT and other AI tools like Midjourney, an image generator from natural language descriptions, have been rising in popularity for the past year. The advent of new AI tools provides unprecedented access to vast amounts of information from various sources. These tools may undermine established narratives and traditional knowledge hierarchies, which leads to the reevaluation of long-held beliefs. 

AI tools have also prompted discussions and debates around ethical considerations like privacy and data security. AI tools that do writing or generative art have also sparked backlash because they can create stunning writing and artworks with little human input using data from millions of works from writers and artists, which puts into reconsideration laws about copyright. The power of AI lies in its ability to continuously improve with more data, meaning that AI tools are starting to take over a lot of industries like medicine and finance, which will push people from these industries to familiarize themselves and incorporate AI into their work. In the same way that calculators and computers didn't replace engineers and scientists, AI will not replace any jobs that require creativity, critical thinking, or problem-solving skills; AI tools are just changing our long-held beliefs about work and productivity. AI tools like ChatGPT change established values and beliefs we've had since the advent of computers by revolutionizing access to information, making it easier and quicker to find relevant knowledge while prompting us to reimagine our work by automating tasks and encouraging a shift towards higher-level thinking and problem-solving roles.
