- I had a traumatic experience involving my mother's health.
- I faced a critical situation when my mother attempted an overdose.
- This event occurred unexpectedly one night, causing me deep distress and fear.
- My father rushed my mother to the hospital, leaving me to cope alone.
- During the wait, I was consumed with worry and prayed for my mother's recovery.
- My mother survived, deeply affecting both me and my father.
- The incident left me traumatized and unable to focus on daily activities.
- As a result, I took a gap year from studies to care for my mother and recover from the trauma.
- Motivated by this experience, I created "MINDPEACE," an app to support mental health.
- I also founded mental health awareness clubs in schools to help others.
- The experience shaped my perspective on life and fueled my commitment to positive influence and change.
