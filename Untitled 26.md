To model the power scaling of One Piece characters (lmao):
$$p(t) = ({at^{2} + bt + c})\frac{1}{e^{r}}$$

- $t$ represents time {$t\in Z^{+}$} ($t_{0}$ can be considered the beginning of One Piece) (a single chapter can be considered a time unit) (younger characters usually benefit more from this) 
- $a$ ($a\geq 0$) is the character's long-term growth potential (over many arcs)
- $b$ ($b\geq 0$) is the character's short-term growth potential (over an arc)
- $c$ ($c>0$) is the character's base power (arbitrary and based on character's past, feats, and titles) (younger characters usually benefit more from this) (older and more experienced characters usually benefit more from this) 
- 


$$\int_{t_{0}}^{t} p(t)\,dt = \int_{t_{0}}^{t}\left(\sqrt[r]{at^{2} + bt + c}\right)\,dt$$
$$P(t)=$$
