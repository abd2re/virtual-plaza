Modelling power scaling of One Piece characters (lmao):
$$p(t) = {\frac{at^{2}}{100} + \frac{bt}{10} + c}$$

- $t$ represents time {$t\in Z^{+}$} ($t_{0}$ can be considered the beginning of One Piece) (unit time can be an arc) (younger characters usually benefit more from this) 
- $a$ {$0\leq a\leq 100$} is the character's long-term growth potential (over many arcs)
- $b$ {$0\leq b\leq 100$} is the character's short-term growth potential (over an arc)
- $c$ {$0\leq c\leq 100$} is the character's base power (arbitrary and based on character's past, feats, and titles) (older and more experienced characters usually benefit more from this)

To get a character's overall power level throughout the series we can integrate $p(t)$:
$$\int_{t_{0}}^{t} p(t)\,dt = \int_{t_{0}}^{t}\left(\frac{at^{2}}{100} + \frac{bt}{10} + c\right)\,dt$$
$$P(t)=\frac{a(t^{3}-t_{0}^{3})}{300}+\frac{b(t^{2}-t_{0}^{2})}{20}+c(t-t_{0})$$


To get a character's potential increase in power level at a specific time in the series we can derive $p(t)$:
$$\frac{d}{dt}p(t)=\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{at^{2}}{100} + \frac{bt}{10} + c\right)$$
$$p'(t)=\frac{at}{50}+\frac{b}{10}$$
